- Confirmation with an export file (.xlsx) : An Excel file containing a list of all described OSS and vulnerability information is downloaded.
- Detailed information related to Vulnerability can be found in [Vulnerability](7_vulnerability.md).
```
1. Check in FOSSLight Hub UI
![self_pop](images/6_self_pop.png)
When you click the Vulnerability icon, the vulnerability information of the corresponding OSS Name and OSS Version is provided in a pop-up window.

2. Confirm with export file
    - Self-Check Sheet
    ![self_check_sheet](images/6_self_sheet1.png)
    The OSS list entered by the user is described in accordance with the FOSSLight Report form.  
    The information in this tab can be used later in Identification of [Project](4_project.md).

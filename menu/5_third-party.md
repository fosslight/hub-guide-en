## Notes
### Create Project for OSS Notice
If the software being distributed is composed solely of 3rd Party Software, you can directly create a **Project > Project** (<U>Identification Confirmed status</U>) from the confirmed 3rd Party Software. However, if identification confirmation is not possible, a project in the identification request status will be created.

## (Admin Only) 3rd Party Review
1. Double-click the 3rd Party with Status : Request in the 3rd Party List.
2. Click the **Review Start** button at the top right.
    - The status will change to Review.
3. Review the red warning messages in the OSS table.
    - If there are red warning messages in the OSS table, confirmation is not possible.
    - To register as a new OSS, double-click the row to open a new OSS registration popup with the information from that row.
4. Once the review is complete, click the Confirm button.
    - If you need to request confirmation from the user again, click the Reject button.

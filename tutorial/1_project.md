#### Project Information
This page is for entering basic information about the project.

- **Project Name**: Enter the project name.
    - If the model name is the same as the project name, input the model name (English is recommended).
- **Project Version**: Enter the project version. Leave blank if not applicable.
- **Permission**: Set project visibility. Choose 'Creator & Watcher' for limited visibility, or 'Everyone' for full visibility.
- **Operating System**: Select the OS or manually input it.
- **Security Mail (Vulnerability)**: Indicates whether to receive Vulnerability emails for the project.
  - By default, Enable is selected.
  - If Disable is selected, Vulnerability emails for the project will no longer be received.
  - When changing to Disable, the reason for disabling must be entered.
- **Distribution Type**: Select the distribution type
    - **General Model**: For distributing general model, software, or applications.
    - **Transfer in-house**: For internal company transfers.
    - **B2B**: When providing to another company.
    - **Preceding Software / In-house only**: For software in early development or not intended for external distribution.
- **Network Service only?**: Select 'Yes' if the project is a network service (e.g., Web Service).
- **Distribution Site**: Select the OSS distribution site where the OSS notice will be registered (e.g., LG Open Source site).
    - **[opensource.lge.com](http://opensource.lge.com/)**: Default distribution site for most cases.
        - <U>For network service projects, also select "opensource.lge.com".</U>
    - **N/A**: Select this option if the OSS notice cannot be registered on a site (e.g., source code is delivered directly to a third party).
- **OSS Notice**: Select the appropriate OSS notice format.
    - **General**: For a standard OSS notice issuance.
    - **Platform-generated**: Choose this if the OSS notice is generated by a platform (e.g., Android, Yocto) and embedded in the product.

- **Model Information**: Enter the model information corresponding to the project, including the release date.
- **Additional Information**: Enter any supplementary information required for compliance.
- **Watcher**: Register users who want to share the project's information and status.  
    - Users registered as Watchers have the same viewing and editing rights as the Creator, and they will receive project-related emails from the system.

**Detailed Features**
- If the written download location is redirected, 
  a recommended OSS Name (Registered OSS Name) will be generated based on the redirect URL,  
  and you can check the redirect URL information at the bottom.
- If the download location is inaccessible, a warning message <span style="color:red">Invalid download location.</span> 
  will be displayed in 'Registered OSS name (to be changed)'.
- Clicking on the recommended OSS Name will show detailed information about that OSS.
- If a row is displayed in gray, it means that more than one OSS was found for the same download location. 
  You can click the cell of the Registered OSS Name to select the OSS Name you want to change.
- Changes made by clicking 'Change OSS Name' or 'Change License' will be immediately reflected in the OSS Table 
  and recorded in the 'Comment'. You can check the change history through the 'Comment'.

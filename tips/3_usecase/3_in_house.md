# Internal Transfer / Preceding Development / Internal Use Project

For internal transfer, preceding development, or internal use,
the OSC Process is completed without distribution and notice issuance.
If open source with disclosure obligations is used, the process is continued to the **Packaging stage**.
If no open source with disclosure obligations is used, the process is completed at the **Identification stage**.

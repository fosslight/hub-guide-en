# Vulnerability Information Collection

- Vulnerability information is downloaded daily from the [NVD Data Feed](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds) 
  and stored in the FOSSLight Hub.
- The Vulnerability Score in the FOSSLight Hub is displayed based on the CVSS v3 Base Score by default.
  If the v3 Score is not available, the CVSS v2 Base Score is used instead.

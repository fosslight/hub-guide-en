# Vulnerability Information Notification

Notification emails are sent when a Vulnerability Score that meets or exceeds the threshold is first registered, 
or when a Vulnerability Score changes from above the threshold to below it.
- If an OSS that meets the above conditions is included in the BOM of a project with confirmed Identification, 
  the changes in the Vulnerability Score are sent to the project's Creator, Watcher, and Reviewer.
